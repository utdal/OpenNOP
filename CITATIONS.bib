There has been a growing desire among network operators to move away from such proprietary elements. Together with other network operators and industry partners, we have created the OpenROADM multi-source agreement and published interoperability specifications as well as YANG data models for OpenROADM-compliant hardware and software. This paper provides an overview of the OpenROADM initiative, its current status, and the results from interoperability tests. It also includes a description of the OpenDaylight TransportPCE project for an OpenROADM-compliant software-defined networking controller.}
