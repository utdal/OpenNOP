abstract = {Transport networks consist of multiple layers, technologies, and areas of deployment. For example, they combine electronic packet and wavelength circuit switching in a single turnkey solution. Conventional solutions have for the longest time segregated the network management and control schemes of these layers, creating silos of operations. This legacy limits flexibility and programmability of extant solutions. In this paper, we describe PROnet, its SDN orchestrator, and a demonstration of its reliability while supporting an advanced manufacturing application running in decentralized mode. PROnet is a two-layer Research and Education Network (REN) under deployed at and around the UT Dallas campus. Resources in the PROnet Ethernet-over-Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) two-layer architecture are managed by a hierarchical SDN orchestrator, which provides two critical functions: 1) on-demand multi-layer path provisioning and 2) coordinated fault handling at both layers. With the first function, the orchestrator automatically provisions optical circuits to efficiently meet the Ethernet flow fault-tolerant requirement as dictated by the application. With the second function, the orchestrator coordinates response procedures at both layers to overcome a first network outage and prepare the network to handle a potential second outage. We refer to this latter function as Multi-layer Protection (implemented at the Ethernet layer) and Restoration (implemented at the WDM layer) mechanism.}

abstract = {Most deployed optical transport networks are proprietary, behaving as a closed, highly coupled, single-vendor managed domain. Although their control planes and management systems may export high-level and open northbound interfaces (NBI), the internal details and interfaces are not disclosed to the network operator. However, driven by the requirements of telecommunication and data-center operators and the need to keep costs down while supporting sustained traffic increase, a trend known as disaggregation has steadily emerged during the past years. It involves composing and assembling open and available components, devices and sub-systems into optical infrastructures and networks, combining ``best-in-class’’ devices, tailored to the specific needs of the aforementioned operators. It has been motivated by factors such as an increase in hardware commoditization, a perceived different rate of innovation of the different components, a promised acceleration in service deployment, or the consequent reduction in operational and capacity expenses. In practice, disaggregation brings multiple challenges, depending on the level that applies (e.g., partial or total, down to each of the optical components) and is taking place in stages. It is commonly accepted that disaggregation implies a trade-off between: (i) the opportunities due to the new degree of flexibility provided by component migration and upgrades without vendor lock-in and (ii) the potential decrease in performance compared to fully integrated systems and the underlying complexity -- including interoperability -, critical in full disaggregation scenarios. From the point of view of control and management, disaggregation heavily relies on the adoption of open interfaces exporting hardware programmability. Disaggregated optical networks are an important use case for the adoption or a unified, model-driven development. In this paper, tutorial in nature, we will introduce the main concepts behind Software Defined Networking (SDN) for disaggregated optical networks, presenting reference architectures and industry common practices related to the adoption of a unified, model driven approach. The second part will cover an overview of selected deployment models (e.g., addressing transceiver and OLS disaggregation) as well as the OpenConfig and OpenROADM optical device models and Transport API (TAPI) interfaces, which constitute the main elements of the implemented SDN control plane. Such control plane targets mainly the metro segment, as defined within the EC Metro-Haul and ONF ODTN projects.},

abstract = {Automating the provisioning of telecommunications services, deployed over a heterogeneous infrastructure (in terms of domains, technologies, and management platforms), remains a complex task, yet driven by the constant need to reduce costs and service deployment time. This is more so, when such services are increasingly conceived around interconnected functions and require allocation of computing, storage, and networking resources. This automation drives the development of service and resource orchestration platforms that extend, integrate, and build on top of existing approaches, macroscopically adopting software-defined networking principles, leveraging programmability, and open control in view of interoperability. Such systems are combining centralized and distributed elements, integrating platforms whose development may happen independently and parallel, and are constantly adapting to ever changing requirements, such as virtualization and slicing. Of specific interest is the (optical) transport network segment, traditionally operated independently via closed proprietary systems, and characterized by being relatively complex and hard to reach consensus regarding modeling and abstraction. In view of the targets, the transport network segment needs to be integrated into such service orchestration platforms efficiently. In this context, this paper aims at providing an introduction to control, management, and orchestration systems, of which the network control is a core component, along their main drivers, key benefits, and functional/protocol architectures. It covers multidomain and multilayer networks and includes complex use cases, challenges and current trends such as joint cloud/network orchestration and 5G network slicing.},
